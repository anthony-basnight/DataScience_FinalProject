    "# Initial Questions\n",
    "### 1. Which attributes affect the quality rating more than others?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Given its attributes, is it possible to predict if a wine will be \"high\" quality (>7)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, we wanted to see if we could predict the exact rating of a wine, but this quickly proved to be tough. Our model wasn't yielding high accuracy (~40%). This could be due to a number of reasons, but the most probable is that the data may be too noisy for a relatively simple model to predict the quality with high accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then tried putting the ratings in \"buckets\" and have the model try to predict the score within a range. The buckets were quality scores of 5 and below, 6 or 7, and 8 and above. This is due to the fact that the largest concentration of quality scores in the dataset are in the 6-8 range. This approach yielded slightly higher accuracy than the first idea, getting closer to 60%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we decided to try to predict if a quality score will be higher than a 7. This would simplify the work the model has to do by giving it a binary classification problem. Using this approach, our model was able to reach 98.7% accuracy with the red wine dataset (1,200 training points, 399 testing points), and 97.9% accuracy with the white wine dataset (3,675 training points, 1,223 testing points). The only problem, was that the model wasn't actually doing any guessing. Due to the nature of the dataset, it just so happens that 98% of the data points have a quality rating of 7 or less, so the model was simply picking 7 or less for everything and managing to get 98% accurate. The white wine model picked 8 or higher twice, and the red wine model never picked 8 or higher at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to have a model that actually made decisions, we lowered the bar for binary classification by having the model predict if the quality score would be higher than a 6. This lowered the accuracy from the previous model (**90.0%** for red wine, **78.5%** for white wine), but at least the model was actually trying to predict when the quality rating was 7 or greater."
