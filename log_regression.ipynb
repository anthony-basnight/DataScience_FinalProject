    "# Initial Questions\n",
    "### 1. Which attributes affect the quality rating more than others?\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the attributes that impact the quality rating the most, we can look at the regression coefficients. Since there is no bias for this model, the equation behind the scenes to guess the quality score is:\n",
    "\n",
    "&omega;<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + &omega;<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + ... + &omega;<sub>j</sub>x<sub>j</sub> = y<sub>i</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "where &omega; is the matrix of regression coefficients, x is the matrix of attribute values, and y<sub>i</sub> is the quality prediction. The larger the magnitude of a regression coefficient is, the larger its impact on the quality rating is. The more positive a regression coefficient is, it has more of a positive impact on the quality of the wine. The more negative it is, it has more of a negative impact on the quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are two different models (red and white wine), there are two different sets of regression coefficients. We can then average the coefficients for each attribute to get the overall impact rating of an attribute, and rank them in sorted order. After averaging the results over 20 trials, this leads us with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes that make a positive impact, from most to least impactful: \n",
    "1. residual sugar: 0.8174\n",
    "2. alcohol: 0.55085\n",
    "3. sulphates: 0.4703\n",
    "4. fixed acidity: 0.404425\n",
    "5. pH: 0.25375\n",
    "6. free sulfur dioxide: 0.139875\n",
    "7. citric acid: 0.008725\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes that make a negative impact, from most to least impactful: \n",
    "1. density: -1.076925\n",
    "2. volatile acidity: -0.424075\n",
    "3. chlorides: -0.342825\n",
    "4. total sulfur dioxide: -0.30405\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Given its attributes, is it possible to predict if a wine will be \"high\" quality (>6)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, we wanted to see if we could predict the exact rating of a wine, but this quickly proved to be tough. Our model wasn't yielding high accuracy (~40%). This could be due to a number of reasons, but the most probable is that the data may be too noisy for a relatively simple model to predict the quality with high accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then tried putting the ratings in \"buckets\" and have the model try to predict the score within a range. The buckets were quality scores of 5 and below, 6 or 7, and 8 and above. This is due to the fact that the largest concentration of quality scores in the dataset are in the 6-8 range. This approach yielded slightly higher accuracy than the first idea, getting closer to 60%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we decided to try to predict if a quality score will be higher than a 7. This would simplify the work the model has to do by giving it a binary classification problem. Using this approach, our model was able to reach 98.7% accuracy with the red wine dataset (1,200 training points, 399 testing points), and 97.9% accuracy with the white wine dataset (3,675 training points, 1,223 testing points). The only problem, was that the model wasn't actually doing any guessing. Due to the nature of the dataset, it just so happens that 98% of the data points have a quality rating of 7 or less, so the model was simply picking 7 or less for everything and managing to get 98% accurate. The white wine model picked 8 or higher twice, and the red wine model never picked 8 or higher at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to have a model that actually made decisions, we lowered the bar for binary classification by having the model predict if the quality score would be higher than a 6. This lowered the accuracy from the previous model (**87.81%** for red wine, **80.18%** for white wine)**, but at least the model was actually trying to predict when the quality rating was 7 or greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: averaged over 20 trials"

    "# Initial Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Which attributes affect the quality rating more than others?\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the most influential attributes on wine quality, we examined feature importance using **XGBoost**. XGBoost models generate feature importance scores based on how frequently and effectively each feature is used to make accurate splits in decision trees. Both red and white wine models provided insight into the importance of specific attributes, with **alcohol**, **volatile acidity**, and **sulphates** emerging as significant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across multiple trials, the most impactful attributes for quality prediction are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes with higher positive impact on quality**:\n",
    "1. **Alcohol** - consistently the most influential feature for both red and white wines, with an average importance of **0.2815**.\n",
    "2. **Volatile Acidity** - also showed high importance, especially in the white wine model, with an average importance of **0.0960**.\n",
    "3. **Sulphates** - contributed positively to quality ratings with an average importance of **0.0840**.\n",
    "4. **Fixed Acidity** - provided additional influence, averaging an importance of **0.0735**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes with negative impact on quality**:\n",
    "1. **Density** - the least favorable feature overall, associated with lower quality, with an average importance of **0.0575**.\n",
    "2. **Chlorides** - contributed negatively, especially in the white wine model, with an average importance of **0.0660**.\n",
    "3. **Total Sulfur Dioxide** - had a slight negative association with quality, averaging **0.0725**.\n",
    "4. **pH** - exhibited some negative impact in both models, with an average importance of **0.0625**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These attributes are consistently relevant across trials, offering insight into the composition and properties that influence wine quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Given its attributes, is it possible to predict if a wine will be \"high\" quality (>6)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, predicting the exact quality score (on a 0-10 scale) proved challenging due to data complexity and inherent noise. Simplifying the problem by \"bucketing\" quality scores into ranges (e.g., below 6, 6-7, above 7) led to moderate accuracy gains around 60%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reframing the problem as a binary classification task—predicting whether a wine’s quality score would exceed a threshold (6 or higher)—yielded significantly better results. **XGBoost**, with its tree-based approach, performed well in identifying wines classified as \"high\" quality (>6) and improved classification for both high and low-quality classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "After hyperparameter tuning and 20 trials, the XGBoost model achieved an average test accuracy as follows:\n",
    "- **Red Wine**: 88.72% accuracy, with improvements in identifying high-quality wines.\n",
    "- **White Wine**: 86.18% accuracy, showing reliable identification of high-quality wines as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Final average accuracy over 20 trials: **88.72%** for red wine, **86.18%** for white wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these results, we conclude that **XGBoost** provides a robust model for predicting if a wine will be rated above a certain quality threshold (6 in this case) based on its attributes. Both red and white wine models demonstrated consistent accuracy, outperforming simpler models. This model is useful for identifying characteristics of quality wine and for preliminarily assessing new wines before tasting, based on measurable attributes alone."
